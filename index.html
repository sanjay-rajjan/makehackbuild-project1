      Hi     
    </h1>
    <p>
      Generating random paragraphs <br>can be an excellent way for writers 
      to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. 
      The writer has no idea what topic <br> the random paragraph will be 
      about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to
      complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer can use 
      the paragraph as the <b>first</b> one of a <i>short story</i> and build upon it. 
      A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short 
      story they <strong>create</strong>. The third option is to have the random paragraph 
      be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these
      challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to 
      incorporate the paragraph into their writing.
